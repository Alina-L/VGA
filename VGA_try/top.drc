WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net myGrid/GRID_X_cmp_ge0000 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp
   instance_name/DCM_SP_INST, consult the device Interactive Data Sheet.
DRC detected 0 errors and 1 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
